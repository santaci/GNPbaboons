# Y chromosome pipeline

In this folder there are two snakemake pipelines built to retrieve portions of the Y chromosome from WGS data both from a single sequencing run (AlignSeqSG.smk) or from many sequencing Runs per sample (AlignSeqMG.smk).

In the example directory there are two suitable samples JSON file for both pipelines and a config file which could be used for both.
